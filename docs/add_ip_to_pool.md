# Add new IP to pool

To add a new node to the ledger pool, it is necessary to also add the respective IP to the iptables table. The following code (executed on the nodeâ€™s vm) adds the ip to the table and saves the extended table.

    sudo bash
    ipset add indy-node-ips <new-nodes-ip>
    ipset save indy-node-ips > /etc/indy-node/ipset.save
    exit
