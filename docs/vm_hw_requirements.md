# VM/HW Requirements

To run the Indy Node we use a VM with at least the following resources:

- fixed IP (Port 9701 and 9702 must be directly accessible).
- 8 G RAM
- 2 (v)CPU cores
- 250G disk space
- Ubuntu 20.04 (by now)

For a productive setup you should have to separate IPâ€™s and network connections.
