# Start the ledger

We are ready to start the ledger (for the first time)

So let's start the ledger on each node and see what happens.. Iâ€™m pretty sure, it will come up.

So go to the vm and start the ledger.. (initially in the foreground, w/o -d option)

    $ cd ~/indy-node-container/run 
    $ sudo docker compose up

The best will be to have a second shell on the vm..

There we can run:

    sudo docker exec -it indy_node validator-info

When all looks good, lets start the ledger in the background. Type Ctrl-C in the first shell to stop docker-compose (frontend).

    <Ctrl-C>
    sudo docker compose down
    sudo docker compose up -d

From now on you can check the logs with:

    # use -f to stream the logging
    sudo docker logs indy_node -f
    # or
    sudo docker logs indy_node_controller -f

Hint try:

    sudo docker ps
